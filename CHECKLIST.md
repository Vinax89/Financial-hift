## üí° TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### Best Practices
- ‚úÖ Activate lazy loading first - biggest impact, lowest risk
- ‚úÖ Test thoroughly after each change
- ‚úÖ Measure before and after for each optimization
- ‚úÖ Migrate one page at a time
- ‚úÖ Keep backup files until confident

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ‚ùå Don't activate everything at once
- ‚ùå Don't skip testing after changes
- ‚ùå Don't forget to restart dev server
- ‚ùå Don't delete backup files immediately
- ‚ùå Don't skip documentation reading

### Performance Monitoring
- ‚úÖ Use Chrome DevTools Network tab
- ‚úÖ Run Lighthouse audits regularly
- ‚úÖ Check console for performance logs
- ‚úÖ Monitor bundle size during builds
- ‚úÖ Track Core Web Vitals

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST

### If pages won't load:
- [ ] Check console for errors
- [ ] Verify file paths are correct
- [ ] Ensure all imports exist
- [ ] Restart development server
- [ ] Clear browser cache

### If performance didn't improve:
- [ ] Verify lazy loading is active (check console)
- [ ] Run production build: `npm run build`
- [ ] Measure with Lighthouse (not just dev server)
- [ ] Check Network tab for code splitting
- [ ] Verify critical routes are prefetching

### If dependencies won't install:
- [ ] Check PowerShell execution policy
- [ ] Try Command Prompt instead
- [ ] Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- [ ] Delete node_modules and reinstall
- [ ] Check npm version: `npm --version`
