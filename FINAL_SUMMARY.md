## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: API KEY NEEDED

To deploy successfully, you need:

### Base44 API Key
- **Required for:** VITE_BASE44_API_KEY environment variable
- **Where to get it:**
  1. Go to https://base44.com (or your Base44 dashboard)
  2. Navigate to: Account Settings → API Keys
  3. Copy your API key
  4. Use it in Vercel environment variables

### If You Don't Have API Key Yet:
- App will deploy successfully
- But API calls may fail (no data displayed)
- You can add the key later in Vercel settings
- Then redeploy

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** "Cannot find my repository in Vercel"
→ **Solution:** Click "Adjust GitHub App Permissions" and grant access

**Issue:** "Build failed - missing dependencies"
→ **Solution:** Already prevented! All dependencies in package.json

**Issue:** "Environment variables not working"
→ **Solution:** Make sure all variables start with `VITE_` prefix

**Issue:** "Page refresh gives 404"
→ **Solution:** Already fixed! vercel.json has SPA rewrites

**Issue:** "Blank page after deployment"
→ **Solution:** Check browser console (F12) for errors, verify API key
