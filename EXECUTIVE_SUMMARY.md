## 🚦 Risk Assessment

### 🔴 High Risk (Must Fix)
1. **Authentication Disabled** - Security risk
   - Impact: Unauthorized access
   - Fix Time: 10 minutes
   - Action: Set `SKIP_AUTH = false` in AuthGuard.jsx

2. **Missing Environment Variables** - App won't work
   - Impact: API calls will fail
   - Fix Time: 5 minutes
   - Action: Create .env file with API keys

### 🟡 Medium Risk (Should Fix)
3. **Console Logging** - Performance & security
   - Impact: Data leakage, slower performance
   - Fix Time: 2-3 hours
   - Action: Replace with logger utility

4. **Incomplete Error Tracking** - No production monitoring
   - Impact: Can't debug production issues
   - Fix Time: 1-2 hours
   - Action: Complete Sentry integration

### 🟢 Low Risk (Nice to Have)
5. **Low Test Coverage** - Harder to maintain
6. **AI Placeholder Logic** - Features not fully functional
7. **Duplicate Files** - Code organization
8. **Missing Documentation** - Onboarding harder
