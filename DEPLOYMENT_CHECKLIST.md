## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Build Failed

**Error:** "Cannot find module"
```
✅ Already prevented! All dependencies in package.json
Should not happen, but if it does:
- Check build logs for specific module
- Verify package.json includes it
- Redeploy
```

### Environment Variable Issues

**Error:** "API_KEY is undefined"
```
Solution:
1. Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Verify VITE_BASE44_API_KEY is set
4. Deployments → Latest → ⋯ → Redeploy
```

### Page Refresh 404

**Error:** Direct URL gives 404
```
✅ Already fixed! vercel.json has SPA rewrites
Should not happen, but if it does:
- Verify vercel.json is in repository root
- Check it contains rewrites configuration
- Redeploy
```

### Blank Page

**Error:** White screen after deployment
```
Solution:
1. F12 → Console tab (check for errors)
2. F12 → Network tab (check for failed requests)
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Check build logs for warnings
```

### Optimistic Updates Not Working

**Error:** Still seeing loading spinners
```
Solution:
1. This means React Query might not be configured
2. Should not happen - already implemented!
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify network is working (could be offline)
```
