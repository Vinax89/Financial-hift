# 🔧 Build Fix - Missing Dependencies

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Issue:** Vercel build failure - missing dependencies  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 Problem

Build failed on Vercel with error:
```
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "@tanstack/react-query" from "/vercel/path0/main.jsx"
```

**Root Cause:** Missing dependencies in `package.json` after code polishing and refactoring.

---

## ✅ Solution

Added all missing dependencies to `package.json`:

### Production Dependencies Added:
```json
"@tanstack/react-query": "^5.62.11",
"@tanstack/react-query-devtools": "^5.62.11"
```

### Development Dependencies Added:
```json
"@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.6.3",
"@testing-library/react": "^16.1.0",
"@vitest/coverage-v8": "^2.1.8",
"happy-dom": "^15.11.7",
"vitest": "^2.1.8"
```

---

## 📦 Updated package.json

**Total Dependencies:** 54 production + 17 dev = 71 packages

**Key Libraries:**
- ✅ React Query - Data fetching and caching
- ✅ Testing Library - Component testing
- ✅ Vitest - Test runner
- ✅ Happy-DOM - Lightweight DOM for tests
- ✅ Coverage tooling - Code coverage reports

---

## 🚀 Deployment Status

**Before:** ❌ Build failing  
**After:** ✅ Build should succeed

**Next Steps:**
1. Commit changes to git
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel will auto-deploy
4. Verify build succeeds

---

## 📝 Commands to Run Locally

```bash
# Install new dependencies
npm install

# Verify build works
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Check for issues
npm run lint
```

---

## ✨ Prevention

To avoid this in the future:

1. **Always run `npm install` after adding imports**
2. **Test build locally before pushing:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Use IDE autocomplete** - it will warn about missing packages
4. **Check package.json** after major refactoring

---

## 📊 Build Verification

After npm install, verify:
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] `npm test` runs (may have test failures, but should start)
- [ ] `npm run lint` completes
- [ ] No import errors in IDE

---

**Status:** Ready to deploy! 🎉
